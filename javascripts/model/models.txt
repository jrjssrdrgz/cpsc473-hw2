Develop a Model module to manage data regarding studentsâ€™ grades.
Each student should have attributes (at least): first name and last name.
Since one student could have more than one grade, you need to implement this one-to-many relationship in your module.
The module would expose a Function constructor so you can use to instantiate the model object.
